I am a statistics major, and statistics is a field that is on a steep rise in demand.
In the past month, I have been making food at work, attending classes, and doing homework.
The three most important strategies for organizing work are keeping a planner or calendar, creating a "to do" list, and having specific areas for work and supplies.
